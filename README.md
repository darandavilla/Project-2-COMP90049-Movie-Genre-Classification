Project 2: Introduction to Machine Learning COMP90049 S1-2020

Romance or Thriller? Movie Genre Prediction from Audio, Visual, and Text Features!

The goal of this project was to build and critically analyse some supervised Machine Learning algorithms, to automatically identify the genre(s) of a movie on the basis of its audio, visual and textual (metadata) features. That is, given a list of movies, the job was to come up with one or more implemented Machine Learning model(s), which were trained using the training dataset, and evaluated using the validation and test dataset. This project aimed to reinforce the largely theoretical machine learning concepts around models, data, and evaluation covered in the lectures, by applying them to an open-ended problem. We also had an opportunity to practice our general problem-solving skills, written communication skills, and creativity. This project had two stages. The focus of this assignment was the report, where we demonstrated the knowledge that we had gained, in a manner that is accessible to a reasonably informed reader.

The report can be seen at Project 2 IML COMP90049.pdf file, and the report questions and details may also be seen in the Proj2-spec_COMP90049.pdf document. Dataset was uploaded in TSV format. Readme.txt file contains the necessary information to run the scripts.
